To plot anything there first must be logs from some run of the neural network learning. 

To plot a learning progress, run 

    $ python plot_learning.py

from this directory. To plot final weights distribution of the first layer of hidden neurons run 

    $ python plot_weights.py

Both scripts require pandas, matplotlib and numpy libraries installed and available for python to import. Resulting plots are in form of PDF files located in this directory.
